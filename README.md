# Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Exam System

## **Step 1: Basic Authentication with Auth0**
- **Goal**: Ensure users can authenticate securely.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up an Auth0 tenant.
  2. Create a basic frontend (React.js or Next.js) with Auth0 integration.
  3. Implement login and logout functionality.
  4. Fetch the user profile from Auth0 to display basic user information (e.g., name, email).

---

## **Step 2: Backend Setup with AWS Lambda**
- **Goal**: Introduce serverless architecture and integrate with the frontend.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Write a simple Lambda function that responds to HTTP requests (e.g., "Hello, World!").
  2. Deploy the Lambda function using AWS Management Console or Terraform.
  3. Expose the Lambda function through an API Gateway endpoint.
  4. Make a simple API call from the frontend to this Lambda function.

---

## **Step 3: Auth0 Token Validation in Lambda**
- **Goal**: Secure the backend using Auth0 tokens.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Modify the Lambda function to validate JWT tokens from Auth0.
  2. Test the API endpoint with a valid Auth0 token to ensure authentication works.
  3. Reject requests with invalid or missing tokens.

---

## **Step 4: Database Setup (DynamoDB)**
- **Goal**: Set up a simple database for storing application data.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create a DynamoDB table to store a simple entity (e.g., users or exams).
  2. Write a Lambda function to interact with the database (e.g., add or fetch data).
  3. Test database operations through API Gateway and Lambda.

---

## **Step 5: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Goal**: Differentiate between `Admin` and `Student` roles.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define roles in Auth0.
  2. Assign roles to users in the Auth0 dashboard.
  3. Update the Lambda function to enforce role-based permissions (e.g., only admins can create exams).

---

## **Step 6: Message Queue Integration (SQS)**
- **Goal**: Introduce queuing for asynchronous tasks.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up an SQS queue.
  2. Write a Lambda function to send messages to the queue.
  3. Create another Lambda function to process messages from the queue.
  4. Test the queue workflow (e.g., submit an exam and process it asynchronously).

---

## **Step 7: Notification System (SNS)**
- **Goal**: Notify users about events (e.g., exam results).
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up an SNS topic.
  2. Write a Lambda function to publish notifications to SNS.
  3. Subscribe to the SNS topic (e.g., via email) and test notifications.

---

## **Step 8: Frontend Integration**
- **Goal**: Connect the frontend to the backend.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Build a basic user interface for students and admins.
  2. Fetch and display data from the backend (e.g., available exams).
  3. Submit data (e.g., exam answers) through the frontend.

---

## **Step 9: Testing and Debugging**
- **Goal**: Ensure the application works as expected.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Test individual components (frontend, backend, database, etc.).
  2. Perform end-to-end tests for user workflows.
  3. Debug any issues and refine the system.

---

## **Step 10: Deployment**
- **Goal**: Deploy the application to production.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use Terraform (or similar) to provision infrastructure.
  2. Deploy the frontend, backend, and database.
  3. Configure a domain name and enable HTTPS for secure access.

By following these steps, you'll get a clear understanding of each component and how they integrate to form the complete Exam System.
